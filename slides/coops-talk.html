              - What makes co-ops unique is that they are not run by
              institutional investors or distant shareholders 
              - Can range from multi-billion pound businesses (John Lewis, Central England Cooperative) to small community enterprises 
              - Healthcare to housing, renewables to retail, sports to social care
              - Co-operatives contribute £36.1 billion a year to the UK economy
              (from Co-operatives UK) 
              - 13.1 million (of 66 million) people own the UK's co-operatives 
              - There are many types of co-ops 
              - owned by the people working there (worker cooperatives) 
              - people buying the co-ops's goods/services (consumer cooperatives) 
              - people collaborating to process / market their products (producer cooperatives) - groups who unite to enhance purchasing power
              (purchasing cooperatives)

              - Co-operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their
              members, who actively participate in setting their policies and
              making decisions. 
              - Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. 
              - In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote), and co operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.

              capital of their co-operative. 
              - At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative. 
              - Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. 
              - Members allocate surpluses for any of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by
              setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the
                co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the

              - Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled
              by their members. 
              - If they enter into agreements with other
              organisations, including governments, or raise capital from
              external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic
              control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
              FAC holds cooperative values and principles, but the structure is
              different
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a non-profit that exists for the benefit of current and
              future students
            </p>

                >Beneficiaries of FAC aren’t the members (like in a co-op) but
                instead the students</span

            <h2>So why is FAC so keen on co-ops?</h2>
            <p class="fragment">
              Supporting co-ops means supporting businesses with similar values
              to FAC
