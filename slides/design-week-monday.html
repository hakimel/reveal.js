            - design thinking is a process for creative problem solving <br />
            - as it is user-centered, it encourages people to focus on the
            people that they are creating for <br />
            - it utilizes elements from the designer's toolkit like empathy and
            experimentation to arrive at innovative solutions. <br/>
            - By using design thinking, you make decisions based on what future customers really
            want instead of relying only on historical data or making risky bets
            based on instinct instead of evidence. <br/>

            - Design thinking provides a roadmap for you to use when developing new services <br/>
            - It relies on the idea of iteration - things can always be improved <br/>
            - Start by identifying a driving question that inspires you and your team to think about who you’re really designing for, and what they actually need <br/>
            - Next, you gather inspiration—what other solutions out in the world can help you rethink the way you’re working? <br/ >
            - Use that to push past obvious solutions, and arrive at breakthrough ideas. <br/>
            - Build rough prototypes to make those ideas tangible, and find what’s working and what’s not. <br/>
            - Gather feedback, go back to the drawing board, and keep going. </br>
            - Some of those steps may happen several times, and you may even jump back and forth between them.

          <aside class="notes">Today, you’ll kick off your sprint by sharing knowledge, understanding the problem, and choosing a target for the week’s efforts. If you don’t first slow down, share what you know, and prioritize, you could end up wasting time and effort on the wrong part of the problem.
Today's structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. In the morning, you’ll start at the end and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll talk to some potential users who may be able to give you additional insight. Finally, you’ll pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">
            - Think about the process that a user would need to undergo to reach your long-term goal. <br />
            - How would a user interact with your product? What steps would they need to take? <br/>
            - What is your main user journey? <br/>
            - Create a flow chart that maps this process from beginning to goal (should be no more than 5-15 steps!)
            - Example: An app that helps you find a restaurant 1. Person is hungry & wants to eat somewhere delicious and close by 2. Open an app on their phone 3. App finds nearby restaurants which include info about the restaurant and customer reviews 4. App provides user with directions on how to go to restaurant 5. Person goes to that restaurant and eats.

            - Start thinking scope (is this something that you can imagine completing in your given time frame)<br/>
            - Can the problem/solution be broken down further? <br/>
            - Remember that although it feels like you have a lot more time on these projects, its often better to choose a scope of project comparable to the projects that you have completed already. This will give you more time to consider things in front-end design (UX/UI), testing, etc.
