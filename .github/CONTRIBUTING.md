## Contributing

Please keep the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues) limited to **bug reports**.

### General Questions and Support

If you have questions about how to use reveal.js the best place to ask is in the [Discussions](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/discussions). Anything that isn't a bug report should be posted as a dicussion instead.

### Bug Reports

When reporting a bug make sure to include information about which browser and operating system you are on as well as the necessary steps to reproduce the issue. If possible please include a link to a sample presentation where the bug can be tested.

### Pull Requests

- Should be submitted from a feature/topic branch (not your master)
- Should follow the coding style of the file you work in, most importantly:
  - Tabs to indent
  - Single-quoted strings

### Plugins

Please do not submit plugins as pull requests. They should be maintained in their own separate repository. More information here: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/wiki/Plugin-Guidelines
