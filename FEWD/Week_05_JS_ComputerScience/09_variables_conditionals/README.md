###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule. These notes are  meant to help you plan an awesome lesson.

####jQuery Basics Review
_Time: 20min_

*	This section is a review from last class. We want to make sure students feel comfortable with the syntax.

#####DOM Selectors

| Code along | [GA Solution File](solution/domSelectors_solution)|
| :------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 20 min|
| __Topics__ | jQuery click event, DOM manipulation|
| __Description__| Review homework assignments|
| __Notes__|  N/A |

===

####Variables
_Time: 40min_

*	Students learn about variables, data types and arithmetic in JavaScript.

#####Score Keeper

|Code along | [GA Solution File](solution/score_keeper)|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min|
| __Topics__ | data types, variables |
| __Description__| Bare bones example that keeps scores. Meant to introduce variables. |
| __Notes__| Starter code is included to save you time. It  is helpful to demo the final product before coding. For beginners, it helps to know the end product before coding. Give students time to look through the HTML code. You can make changes to work with other data types.|

===


####Conditionals
_Time: 50min_

#####Compare That

|Code along | [GA Solution File](solution/compare_that)|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 20 min |
| __Topics__ | conditionals, variables, text box |
| __Description__| Visual representation of conditionals. |
| __Notes__| It is intentional that ID, tag and variable names are similar. We want students to begin to identify the difference. |


#####Blackout

| Code Along | [GA Solution File](solution/blackout) <br> Code pen version available [here](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/ywqEC)|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 15 min |
| __Topics__ | jQuery functions .addClass, .removeClass  |
| __Description__| Updates to Blackout code along to showcase more jQuery functions and best practices when adding interactivity to a website.|
| __Notes__| Allow the students to take the lead on this one. This is a key skill students need for lab time and the next lesson. |

====


####Weather Application - Part 1
_Time: 50min_


| Exercise | No solution file|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 45 min |
| __Topics__ | variables, DOM manipulation |
| __Description__| Three part exercise. The final version of the Temp Converter will take celsius temperature input convert it to  Fahrenheit and change the background image according to the weather. This exercise is the first step in that process|
| __Notes__| We intentionally left out the solution file. Each group should have a unique solution (and that  is ok). If your class is  struggling with the concepts, we suggest helping students through the pseudo code. |

Part 1:

*	As a class, write feature requirements / user stories necessary to create a fully functional application that takes celsius temperature, converts it to Fahrenheit and changes the background to match said temperature.

*	In groups of four write pseudo code for the application.

*	In pairs write the code to convert Celsius into Fahrenheit, and display the result in the browser.
