##Lesson 10 - Functions


###LEARNING OBJECTIVES

*	Describe arguments as they relate to functions.
*	Predict values returned by a given function.
*	Differentiate control flow between anonymous and named functions.

###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule. These notes are  meant to help you plan an awesome lesson.

####Functions
_Time : 60min_

At this point, we don't expect students to write functions that return values on their own.

We want to incrementally build on student's understanding of functions. Student's understand functions as code that alters the flow of control of the program. This section we formally introduce arguments, returns and anonymous functions. This lesson should ultimately add to students understanding of jQuery, and help them better read the docs.

__NOTE__ The top two questions students have about functions are:

>"When do I use them?"
>"Where do I put them?"



#####Cash Register

| Code along | [GA Solution File](solution/cash_register)|
| :------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min|
| __Topics__ | functions, arguments, returns, anonymous functions  |
| __Description__| A simple application to help demonstrate functions. This application takes an amount and adds it to a receipt. |   
| __Notes__| We found it helps to discuss / write the pseudocode for the application before starting to code. The solution key for this exercise includes some advanced code. If your students are ready for the leap share the solution code as is. If not, refactor the exercise to something that is more manageable for your students. This application explains return functions. Next lesson we refactor this exercise to use anonymous functions.|


#####Anonymous Cash Register

|Code along  | [GA Solution File](solution/cash_register) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min |
| __Topics__ | functions, arguments, returns, anonymous functions  |
| __Description__| A simple application to help demonstrate anonymous functions. This application takes an amount and adds it to a receipt. |   
| __Notes__| Refactor this exercise to use anonymous functions. It will be important to explain to students why you may use an anonymous function over a named function. |

####Revising jQuery
_Time : 30min_

*	Now that students know more about functions, you can have a more detailed conversation/explanation about jQuery and how it works. In addition you can better explain how to read the jQuery docs. This section is a good opportunity to describe document.ready() function, and how to use it.

*	This section is open to instructors. This is an opportunity to show students other jQuery functions and events.

* Introduce and explain this week's follow-up weather app assignment.  Point out that it is very similar to what we will be practicing in class but that programmers do this all the time: revisit the in-class code you've written to get guidance on how to work through the homework.  Point out that in the real world, engineers frequently revisit applications and code they've written to find solutions to problems they've already solved.


####Weather Application - Part 2
_Time : 60min_

| Exercise | No solution file|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 60 min |
| __Topics__ | variables, DOM manipulation |
| __Description__| 3 part exercise. The final version of the Temp Converter will take celsius temperature input convert it to  Fahrenheit and change the background image according to the weather. This is the first step in that process|    
| __Notes__| Part 2 students begin to code the application. |

=======

*	Complete Celsius to Fahrenheit code

*	Add background changing functionality.
