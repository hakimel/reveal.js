# FEWD: Final Project

---


### Description

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a website of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of front-end web development and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a website that you can add to your portfolio.  You could create: a portfolio website; a marketing website for a startup or business; or a prototype for a simple web-app. Work with your instructor and EIR's to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

We recommend you take a look at the [GA Gallery](http:/gallery.ga.co) for examples of past student work.

  - First draft of JS
  - Updated Rough Draft

- Use HTML to correctly structure the DOM:
  - Use HTML5 structural elements (header, footer, nav, footer)
  - Demonstrate a correct use of classes and IDs

#### Bonus / Best Practices

Your instructional team will provide feedback on how well you execute best practices. Even though it is not part of the requirements, you should keep these in mind:

- __Clean And Readable Code__. The instructional team should be able to read and follow your code easily.  Maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting (e.g. when closing `<div>` tags, demarcating sections of code, describing possibly ambiguous code choices) and use of proper and consistent naming conventions.

- __Search Engine Optimization (SEO)__. Implement SEO best practices related to HTML markup, and content optimization.

## Hosting

You can host your final project on the web for free using GitHub pages. Watch [this video](https://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/jn23v1hc93) and see [this](Getting_Started_with_GitHub_Pages.pdf) guide for more information on how to host your site on GitHub pages.

###Evaluation / Submission

Students will create a new repository on GitHub for their final project and push their code to this new repository when they are ready to submit. The instructional team will grade each technical requirement and provide a numeric grade on a scale: does not meet expectations (0); meets expectations (1); exceeds expectations (2).  **Note**: If bullet points have child bullets, the instructional team should grade the child bullets and not the parent bullet belonging to the child. The maximum possible score on this assignment is 22/22. Bonus sections are completely optional.
