###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section and ICL from the proposed schedule above. These notes are  meant to help you plan for a great class.


####Intro To Programming Review
_Time: 20min_

*	This is a great opportunity to review the traffic light example from the previous class. Will be using it again

*	This section is dedicated to reviewing what programming is. It is important to let students know that syntax can always be looked up, but programming is about solving problems, often students think it is only about syntax. Students will practice syntax and problem solving skills in the next sections.

===


####Intro To jQuery
_Time: 30min_

*	In this section we want to make a case for using jQuery. The goal is to show students that by using it, we can significantly reduce the lines of code.


| Code along | jQuery Color Switcher - no solution file |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 10 min|
| __Topics__ | jQuery |
| __Description__| Quick example to show students that jQuery can significantly reduce the lines of code using jQuery.|
| __Notes__| n/a |


===


####jQuery Basics
_Time: 60min_

*	The purpose of this section is to introduce students to jQuery syntax.

* This is meant to be an introduction. Students are learning syntax, and don't yet know how to read documentation, so we suggest using a limited number of jQuery functions and only demonstrating the click event. It can be difficult to explain jQuery to students with their limited knowledge of code at this point. It helps to make sure this section is very prescriptive.

This is our suggested limited list of functions to share.

```
.click
.slideToggle() 
.hide()
.show()
.slideUp()
.slideDown()
.children()
.attr()
```

| Code along | jQuery Traffic Light - no solution file |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 15 min|
| __Topics__ | jQuery syntax|
| __Description__| An example that demonstrates how to add jQuery CDN / file and syntax |
| __Notes__| This is the same activity that students completed last class. We've pulled the example off of code pen, to show students how they would develop locally, in addition to review jQuery syntax. It would be beneficial to build the functionality with a clean .js file. We don't want students to translate JavaScript to jQuery, we want them to build an understanding of jQuery.|


| Exercise | [Syntax Drill](http://codepen.io/GeneralAssembly/pen/EAubl?editors=110) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min|
| __Topics__ | jQuery syntax|
| __Description__| Dictation style activity, to help students practice jQuery syntax. |
| __Notes__| This exercise is meant to be used with code pen, students should log in and fork the exercise from Code Pen. Instructors ask students to make changes to the DOM (browser view in code pen). Show students correct answers after each ask. Here is an example of some DOM changes you can ask students to complete. Use jQuery syntax to change all p tags to blue. Use jQuery to change the size of the boxes etc. |

===

####Adding Interactivity
_Time: 70min_

*	This section centers around the FAQ code along / exercise. The goal is to show students how to apply what they learned about programming (solving problems) last class and the syntax from this class.

*	Meant to teach students the process of adding interactivity and continue to practice jQuery syntax.

* Once you've demonstrated and practiced this introductory jQuery, be sure to introduce and outline [this week's assignment](../AssignmentREVISED) before class ends.

| Class Exercise |[FAQs Solution In Code Pen](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/mKzvs) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 70min |
| __Topics__ | jQuery functions, adding interactivity|
| __Description__|As a class build an interactive accordion style FAQ section. |
| __Notes__| This exercise is meant to teach students the process of adding interactivity and continue to practice using jQuery. See here for [notes](solution/notes_from_the_curriculum_fellow.md) from the Curriculum Fellow |
