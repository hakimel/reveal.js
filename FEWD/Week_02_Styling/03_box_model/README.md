###LESSON PLANNING NOTES

Below you will find notes on each section from the proposed schedule above. These notes are  meant to help you plan for a great class.

####Box Model
_Time: 50min_

This section is meant to build students understanding of how elements are spaced on the page.

*	Our examples use familiar tags to teach students about box model. We wanted students to only learn box model and not any new tags. In the following example we will show students classes and ids and how the box model applies.


|Code along | [Tags & Boxes](solution/tags_boxes) |
|:------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | ~20 min |
| __Topics__ | margin, padding, box model |
| __Description__| A code example to help explain box model. |   
| __Activity Type__| Code along |

####Selectors & The DOM
_Time: 20min_

*	We use block quotes and other nested tags to show students how to be more precise with their selectors. Students often struggle with selecting elements on the page that are nested between other tags.

*	Students find it helpful to draw a DOM tree on the white board.



| Exercise | Draw Me A DOM |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | ~10 min |
| __Topics__ | drawing a DOM tree |
| __Description__|Students take what they learned about the DOM and draw a tree for the [assignment files](../Assignment/)|   
| __Notes__| This is a group exercise. We use DIVs in assignment file, you will have to briefly explain that it sections content and we will discuss more next class.|


| Code along| [Nested Selectors](solution/nested_selectors) |
| :------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | ~10 min |
| __Topics__ | selectors, block quotes, nesting |
| __Description__| Students practice nesting elements and selecting elements that are nested. |   
| __Notes__| |

####Lab Time
_Time: 60min_

*	We've found that students sometimes spend the first 30 min of lab time, pondering what to do first. This lab time we want to help them take those first steps.


|Group discussion | How To Start |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 10 min |
| __Topics__ | starting a project |
| __Description__| Guide students in taking the first steps to building the Relaxr landing page. |   
|__Notes__| If you were given the Relaxr site part 1, what is the first thing  you would do. The goal here is to teach students that process, how to start.|



|Exercise|[Relaxr Landing Page: Part 1](../Assignment/README.md)|
|:------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 50 min |
| __Topics__ | html, css, divs, ids, classes |
| __Description__| Students use the relaxr_ladning.jpg to begin their week's assignment: Recreate Relaxr's landing page. |    
| __Notes__| This lab also test the students ability to be resourceful.  Encourage them to use online documentation to help them through issues or errors. Also, point out that this is an assignment that will be finished away from class. |
