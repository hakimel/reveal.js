###Week 6 - Review & Refactor

This week, we teach students how to write more efficient code. We will introduce debugging techniques and the keyword "this". We also ask students to rewrite code after they learn refactor and debugging techniques.

For [homework](Assignment/README.md), students will iterate on the 'CitiPix' application from last week, incorporating what they've learned about arrays.
